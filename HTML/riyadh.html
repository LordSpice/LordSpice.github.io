            <h1>Riyadh City:</h1>
            Riyadh (Arabic: الرياض‎, romanized: ar-Riyāḍ, lit. 'The Gardens' [ar.riˈjaːdˤ] Najdi 
            pronunciation: [er.rɪˈjɑːðˤ]) is the capital city and seat of government of the Riyadh 
            Province and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the largest city on the Arabian Peninsula and 
            the capital governorate of the Riyadh Province. Located in the center of the an-Nafud 
            desert, on the eastern part of the Najd plateau, the city sits at an average of 600 
            metres (2,000 ft) above sea level, and receives more than 16 million tourists each 
            year, making it the 2nd most visited city in the Arab world. Riyadh had a population 
            of 7.6 million people in 2019, making it the most populous city in Saudi Arabia, 2nd most 
            populous city in the Arab world (after Cairo), and the 38th most populous in Asia.

            The first mentioning of the city by the name Riyadh was in 1590, by an early Arab 
            chronicler. In 1737, Deham Ibn Dawwas, who was from the neighboring Manfuha, 
            settled in and took control of the city. Deham built a wall around the city, and 
            the best known source of the name Riyadh is from this period, thought to be referring 
            to the earlier oasis towns that predated the wall built by Ibn Dawwas. In 1744, 
            Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah, Muhammad 
            bin Saud, and in 1774, they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state, now known 
            as the First Saudi State, came to a collapse in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the 
            Second Saudi State in the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. 
            However, his reign over the city was disrupted by a joint Ottoman–Rashidi alliance. 
            Finally, in the early 20th century, 'Abdulaziz ibn Saud, known in the west simply as 
            Ibn Saud, retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule 
            by 1926 with the final Saudi conquest of Hejaz. After this he named his kingdom 
            Saudi Arabia in September 1932 with Riyadh as the capital.
            
            Riyadh is the political and administrative centre of Saudi Arabia. The Consultative 
            Assembly (also known as the Shura or Shura Council), the Council of Ministers of 
            Saudi Arabia, the King and the Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia are all 
            situated in the city. Alongside these four bodies that form the core of the legal 
            system of Saudi Arabia, the headquarters of other major and minor governmental bodies 
            are also located in Riyadh. The city hosts 112 foreign embassies, most of which 
            are located in the as-Safarat district or Diplomatic Quarter (Arabic: حي السفارات‎, 
            romanized: Hayy as-Safarat, lit. 'District of Embassies') in the western reaches of 
            the city.
            
            Riyadh also holds great economic significance, as it hosts the headquarters of many 
            banks and major companies, such as the National Commercial Bank (NCB), Alinma Bank 
            and the Saudi Arabian British Bank (SABB). Highway 65, known locally as the King Fahd 
            Road, runs through some of these important centers in the city, including the King 
            Abdullah Financial District, one of the world's largest financial districts, the 
            Faisaliyah Center and the Kingdom Center. Riyadh is one of the world's fastest-growing 
            cities in population and is home to many expatriates. Riyadh has been designated a global 
            city.

            <h1>Geography:</h1>
            Riyadh is divided into fourteen branch municipalities, in addition to the Diplomatic 
            Quarter. Each branch municipality in turn contains several districts, amounting to over 
            130 in total, though some districts are divided between more than one branch municipality. 
            The branch municipalities are Al-Shemaysi, Irqah, Al-Ma'athar, Al-Olayya, Al-Aziziyya, 
            Al-Malaz, Al-Selayy, Nemar, Al-Neseem, Al-Shifa, Al-'Urayja, Al-Bat'ha, Al-Ha'ir, 
            Al-Rawdha, and Al-Shimal ("the North"). Olaya District is the commercial heart of the 
            city, with accommodation, entertainment, dining and shopping options. The Kingdom 
            Centre, Al Faisalyah and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks. The 
            centre of the city, Al-Bathaa and Al-Deerah, is also its oldest part.
            
            <h1>Sports:</h1>
            Football is the most popular sport in Saudi Arabia. The city hosts four major football 
            clubs, Al Hilal was established in 1957 and has won 15 championships in the Saudi 
            Professional League. Al-Nasr club is another team in the top league that has many 
            supporters around the kingdom. It was established in 1955, and has been named champion of 
            the Saudi League 7 times. Another well-known club, Al-Shabab, was established 
            in 1947 and holds 6 championships. There is also Al-Riyadh Club, which was established in 
            1954, as well as many other minor clubs.

            The city also has several large stadiums such as King Fahd International Stadium with a 
            seating capacity of 70,000. The stadium hosted the FIFA Confederations Cup three 
            times, in the years 1992, 1995 and 1997. It also hosted the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 1989, 
            and Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium (Al-Malaz Stadium) that is used mostly for football 
            matches. The stadium has a capacity of 22,500 people.

            The city's GPYW Indoor Stadium served as host arena for the 1997 Asian Basketball 
            Championship, where Saudi Arabia's national basketball team reached the Final Four.

            On 29 February 2020, the world's richest thoroughbred horse race will take place at 
            the King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh. The Saudi Cup is a new race for thoroughbreds 
            aged four and up, to be run at weight-for-age terms over 1800m (9f). The prize money is 
            US$20m with a prize of US$10m to the winner and prize money down to tenth place. 
            The Saudi Cup is perfectly positioned between the Pegasus World Cup and the Dubai 
            World Cup to attract the best horses from around the world to compete for horse 
            racing's richest prize. Putting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the international 
            horseracing map, the Saudi Cup will also hold an undercard of international races 
            on both dirt and the new turf course.

            On 26 April 2020, Saudi Arabia entered the bidding process for the 2030 Asian Games, 
            there main rival for this event is Doha, Qatar.
