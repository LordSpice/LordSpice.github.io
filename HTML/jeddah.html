            <h1>Jeddah City:</h1>
            Jeddah (English: /ˈdʒɛdə/ JED-ə), also spelled Jedda, Jiddah or Jidda (/ˈdʒɪdə/ JID-ə; 
            Arabic: جدة‎, romanized: Jidda, Hejazi pronunciation: [ˈdʒɪd.da]), is a city in the Hejaz 
            region of Saudi Arabia and the country's commercial center. With a population of about 3.5 
            million people (as of 2020), Jeddah is the largest city in Makkah Province, the 
            second-largest in Saudi Arabia (after the capital Riyadh), and the tenth-largest in 
            the Arab world. Jeddah Islamic Port, located on the Red Sea, is the second-largest 
            and second-busiest seaport in the Arab world (after Dubai's Port of Jebel Ali).

            Jeddah is the principal gateway to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, located just 65 
            kilometres (40 mi) to the east, while Medina, the second-holiest city, is located 360 
            kilometres (220 mi) to the north.

            Economically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital investment in 
            scientific and engineering leadership within Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East. 
            Jeddah was independently ranked fourth in the Africa – Mid-East region in terms of 
            innovation in 2009 in the Innovation Cities Index.

            Jeddah is of Saudi Arabia's primary resort cities and was named a Beta world city by 
            the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network (GaWC). Given the city's 
            close proximity to the Red Sea, fishing and seafood dominates the food culture unlike 
            other parts of the country. In Arabic, the city's motto is "Jeddah Ghair", which 
            translates to "Jeddah is different". The motto has been widely used among both locals 
            as well as foreign visitors. The city had been previously perceived as the "most open" 
            city in Saudi Arabia.

            <h1>Geography:</h1>
            Jeddah is located in Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coastal plain (called Tihamah). 
            Jeddah lies in the Hijazi Tihama (Arabic: تهامة الحجاز) region which is in 
            the lower Hijaz mountains. Historically, politically and culturally, Jeddah was 
            a major city of Hejaz Vilayet, the Kingdom of Hejaz and other regional political 
            entities according to Hijazi history books. It is the 100th largest city in the 
            world by land area.
            
            <h1>Historical Jeddah:</h1>
            Historical Jeddah is situated on the eastern shore of the Red Sea. From the 7th 
            century AD it was established as a major port for Indian Ocean trade routes, 
            channelling goods to Mecca. It was also the gateway for Muslim pilgrims to Mecca 
            who arrived by sea. These twin roles saw the city develop into a thriving multicultural 
            centre, characterized by a distinctive architectural tradition, including tower 
            houses built in the late 19th century by the city's mercantile elites, and combining 
            Red Sea coastal coral building traditions with influences and crafts from along the 
            trade routes.
