            <h1>Dhahran City:</h1>
            Dhahran (Arabic الظهران Al-Thahran) is a city located in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. 
            It is a major administrative center for the Saudi oil industry. Together with the nearby 
            cities of Dammam and Khobar, Dhahran forms part of the Dammam Metropolitan Area, 
            which is commonly known as greater Dammam and has an estimated population of 4,140,000 
            as of 2012.

            Large oil reserves were first identified in the Dhahran area in 1931, and in 1935, 
            Standard Oil drilled the first commercially viable oil well. Standard Oil later 
            established a subsidiary in Saudi Arabia called the Arabian American Oil Company 
            (ARAMCO), now owned by the Saudi government and known as Saudi Aramco. Dhahran has 
            been the home of Saudi Aramco's headquarters for 80 years and is its first and largest 
            gated compound with more than 50,000 residents. Employees and dependents of Aramco, 
            known as Aramcons, have a tendency to use Dhahran to solely refer to the Aramco camp 
            while using Khobar and/or Dammam to refer to the area outside the camp. The Saudi Aramco 
            Residential Camp makes up much of the city of Dhahran today. Home to Mall of Dhahran one 
            of the biggest shopping complexes in the Eastern Province.

            <h1>Geography:</h1>
            Dhahran is a short distance west of downtown Khobar. It is about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) 
            south of Dammam. Both are older Saudi port cities on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 
            Looking farther afield, Dhahran is northeast of Abqaiq, and southeast of Qatif and, 
            further north, Ras Tanura, a major oil port. The Kingdom of Bahrain is also within easy 
            driving distance to the east (about 32 km [20 mi]), across the King Fahd Causeway, from 
            Khobar.

            There are several notable landmarks in Dhahran City including KFUPM clock tower as well as 
            Saudi Aramco's Al-Midra Tower and King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture. However, the 
            tallest building in Dhahran is Al-AbdelKareem Tower, where the neighboring Al-Othman twin 
            towers come as second tallest, all located at Al-Qashlah district in the north east of the 
            city facing Al-Khobar.
            
            <h1>Economy:</h1>
            Dhahran has the headquarters of Saudi Aramco. The company is the largest oil company 
            in the world with the largest oil reserves in the world, and it produces about 10 
            million barrels of oil per day. Most of the oil is exported, since local Saudi needs 
            require about 12% of the total production.

            Eighty-seven years on, Dhahran is still Saudi Aramco's worldwide headquarters and the 
            center of the company's finance, exploration, engineering, drilling services, medical 
            services, materials supply and other company organisations.
